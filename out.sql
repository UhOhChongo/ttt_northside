We understand that our success is a function of yours and want you to rest assured that we will continue to stand behind every Northside product,\r\nlong after the sale.”\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with the debut of the spring/summer 2014 line to trade audiences, Northside will implement new practices and systems to better support the company’s dealers. Efforts include extensive sales rep training, more effective point of sale materials, additional branding assets, increased owner visibility and availability, re-vamped delivery processes and accountability standards, and an overall show of appreciation with engaging on-floor initiatives.  Not only will these efforts further the reinvestment plans, but they will also embody and bring to life the brand’s updated tagline: “Just for Fun.”\r\n\r\n“As the Northside brand continues to build a following in\r\nthe outdoor marketplace, Jeff, Bob, and I recognized that the next step towards\r\nsuccess is to really grow and support the programs that bring success to our\r\npartners,” said Wolfin. “We know that any victory we see is a result of our\r\ndealers’ achievements, and we want to ensure that we are doing everything\r\npossible to enable these partners to reach their goals, to have fun doing it,\r\nand to know that we have their backs. Our product isn’t changing; nor is our\r\nvision – we are simply making a larger effort to show our appreciation to those\r\nwho make our business work.”\r\n\r\nThough the Northside Promise is new for the brand, Northside\r\nremains committed to creating the same quality footwear that consumers have\r\ncome to expect. The spring/summer 2014 line will further the brand’s standard\r\nof on-trend, dependable shoes for the whole family at a great value.\r\n\r\nFor more information on the Northside brand and products,\r\nvisit <a href=\"http://www.northsideusa.com\">www.northsideusa.com</a>, and stay\r\ntuned for updates on the Northside Promise.\r\n\r\n<strong>About Northside</strong>\r\nNorthside by Triple T Trading is a quality footwear brand\r\nfor all-seasons, available in contemporary styles.

But when you\'re aptly caffeinated and ask the riled up little ones where they want to hike today, you’re met with groans and complaints: “Hiking is boring!” “I hate hiking.” “Not again!”\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong><a style=\"color: #800000;\" title=\"NORTHSIDE KIDS ACTIVE SHOES\" href=\"http://northsideusa.com/shoes/category/kids-active/\" target=\"_blank\">FOR YOUR GROWING HIKER: NORTHSIDE KIDS\' ACTIVE SHOES</a></strong></span>\r\n\r\nBut you know that hiking isn’t boring and more importantly, that your kiddos need exercise ASAP. Here are a few tips for getting them outside and in the hills.<a href=\"http://northsideusa.com/2014/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1866603320_16dd6e77b2_o.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-21382\" src=\"http://northsideusa.com/2014/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1866603320_16dd6e77b2_o.jpg\" alt=\"hiking-with-kids\" width=\"3872\" height=\"2592\" /></a><i>Photo credit: Mike Barlow/Flickr</i>\r\n\r\n<strong>Make the hike into a game</strong>\r\n\r\n“I spy\" is a perfect trail game. Make and bring along bingo boards that list possible finds, so if the kids unearth five items that are listed in a row, they win a prize. To keep them interested throughout the hike, list easy treasures (hearing a bird whistle, finding a heart-shaped rock, collecting six pinecones) and mix in some less likely items (seeing a deer, finding an arrowhead, spying a hawk).\r\n\r\nThe prize at the end? An extra scoop of ice cream or a really cool rock found at the local nature store that can be traded between each hike’s winner.<a href=\"http://northsideusa.com/2014/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/8282458845_c021f29a6e_o.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-21385\" src=\"http://northsideusa.com/2014/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/8282458845_c021f29a6e_o.jpg\" alt=\"snack spot\" width=\"3000\" height=\"2417\" /></a><em>Photo credit: dolanh/Flickr</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Bribery</strong>\r\n\r\nAs much as we’d like to be, most of us aren’t above blatant bribery. Whether it’s feeding them throughout the hike with (mostly M&amp;M-filled) trail mix, a promise of a post-hike frozen treat or getting an extra 30 minutes with mom’s iPad at night, enticement works. Often they’ll forget about the bribery after a few steps into the trail and will just enjoy being outside.<a href=\"http://northsideusa.com/2014/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/532314966_75c4c291ff_o.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-21383\" src=\"http://northsideusa.com/2014/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/532314966_75c4c291ff_o.jpg\" alt=\"532314966_75c4c291ff_o\" width=\"800\" height=\"649\" /></a><i>Photo credit: Jonf728/Flickr</i>\r\n\r\n<strong>Have a goal</strong>\r\n\r\nAlthough many hikes top out with beautiful views, some younger kids just don’t care how gorgeous the mountain in the distance is, or the amazing fall colors. Instead, have something they can look forward to on the hike. On a hot day, take them to a hike that ends at a lake perfect for a refreshing swim. Or tempt them with the perfect hollow rock that doubles as a secret fort. Or, as a fall-appropriate adventure, hike them to apple trees. There, they can eat their fill of the sweet, juicy apples while you pack them in your bag for apple pie baking later.<a href=\"http://northsideusa.com/2014/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2397012858_277b3f403a_o.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-21384\" src=\"http://northsideusa.com/2014/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2397012858_277b3f403a_o.jpg\" alt=\"2397012858_277b3f403a_o\" width=\"2206\" height=\"1471\" /></a><em>Photo credit: woodleywonderworks/Flickr</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Incorporate a project</strong>\r\n\r\nIf your child is <em>still </em>not excited about the trek through the woods, associate it with something that he or she is interested in. For example, if your 10 year old likes arts and crafts, have him collect flowers, pretty leaves and feathers to create a scrapbook or poster later. Or, if your eight year old enjoys science, make sure to point out the bird’s nest you see and have her take photos with your iPhone. Then, later, you can research what kind of bird those eggs belong to.\r\n\r\nDo you have tricks to get your kids to go on a hike?

family owned and operated business, Northside knows exactly how important it is to bring people together to support and celebrate one another.\r\n\r\nThis holiday season, Northside reached out to how they could help their neighbors in inner city Seattle and bring people together. In doing so, Northside made the holidays a little bit warmer for members of a local Boys and Girls Club.\r\n\r\nIn partnership with <span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><a style=\"color: #ff6600;\" title=\"Project Sole\" href=\"projectsole.org\" target=\"_blank\">Project Sole</a></span>, Northside packed up over 500

The warm smiles, hugs and high-fives from all of the kids makes all of this worth it.\"\r\n\r\nWatch the video and see for yourself the difference new shoes can make.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/7ZrEsJQZDr4\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nFrom the video: “We are so grateful to have Northside and Project Sole come here to our club to visit with us, to see what we do, and then to provide shoes for all of our kids.
