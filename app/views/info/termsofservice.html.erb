<li><h3> Dispute Resolution; Arbitration</h3></li>
</ol>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH NORTHSIDE AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Binding Arbitration</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Except for disputes in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Northside: (a) waive your right to have any and all disputes or Claims arising from these Terms, the Services or your purchase of a product through the Services (collectively, &#8220;<strong><em>Disputes</em></strong>&#8220;) resolved in a court; and (b) waive your right to a jury trial. Instead, you and Northside will arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You and NORTHSIDE agree that any Dispute is personal to you and NORTHSIDE and that such Dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. Neither party agrees to class arbitration or to an arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, you and NORTHSIDE agree that a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Federal Arbitration Act</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You and Northside agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 14 shall be governed by, construed and enforced, both substantively and procedurally, by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Â§ 1 et seq. (the &#8220;<strong><em>FAA</em></strong>&#8220;) to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Process</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You and Northside agree that you will notify each other in writing of any Dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to Northside shall be sent by certified mail or courier to: Northside, Attn: Customer Service, P.O. Box 124, Marysville, Washington 98271. Your notice must include: (1) your name, postal address and email address; (2) a description of the nature or basis of the Dispute; and (3) the specific relief that you are seeking. If you and Northside cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after Northside receives your notice, either you or Northside may, as appropriate pursuant to this Section 14, commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in court. You and Northside agree that any arbitration or claim must be commenced or filed within one (1) year after the Dispute arose; otherwise, you and Northside agree that the claim is permanently barred (which means that you will no longer have the right to assert a claim regarding the Dispute). You and Northside agree that (a) any arbitration will occur near your city of residence; (b) arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; and (c) the state or federal courts in your state of residence will have exclusive jurisdiction over the enforcement of an arbitration award and over any Dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authority of Arbitrator</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As limited by the FAA, these Terms and applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual&#8217;s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rules of JAMS</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong><br />
The rules of, and additional information about, JAMS are available on the JAMS website at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/">http://www.jamsadr.com/</a>, as may be updated from time to time. By agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either (a) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS or (b) waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severability</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong><br />
If any provision of this Section 14 is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law and all other provisions will remain valid and enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth in Section 14.2 are severable from the other provisions of these Terms and will remain valid and enforceable except as prohibited by applicable law.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Changes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong><br />
Notwithstanding the provisions herein related to modifications of these Terms, if Northside revises this Section 14 after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change within thirty (30) days of the date such change became effective by providing Northside written notice of such rejection and delivering such notice to: Northside, Attn: Customer Service, P.O. Box 124, Marysville, Washington 98271. In order to be effective, your written notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to this Section 14. By rejecting such changes, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with the last version of the Terms you accepted.</p>
